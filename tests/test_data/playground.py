                Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing
                a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A
                yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained
                gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the
                bowl aloft and intoned::
                
                -- Introibo ad altare Dei.

                Args:
                    arg1 (int): This is a short description.
                    arg2 (str): This is a long description that spans
                        multiple lines and should be unwrapped onto the
                        signature line.
                    arg3 (bool): This description has a table.

                        +-----+-----+
                        | A   | B   |

                        +-----+-----+

                        And some text after.
                    arg4 (list):
                        This description starts on the next line.
                    arg5 (int): This description contains a double colon block::

                            P(B|A) P(A)
                        P(A|B) = -------------
                                    P(B)

                        And text after it.
                    arg6 (str): This description contains a bullet list:
                        - First bullet point that is intentionally long but not wrapped
                        - Second point also stays on one line regardless of length
                    arg7 (list): This description contains a bullet list with a different format:
                        1. First item
                        2. Second item

                Returns:
                    dict[str, str]:
                        The return value is something that we
                        all want to see but yes it is something we all want to see.
