LINE_LENGTH: 79

**********
Args:
    arg1 (int): This is a normal parameter description.
    arg2 (list[str]): This is a parameter with a very long description that needs to be wrapped because it exceeds the line length limit significantly and we want to ensure it looks good.
    arg3 (Optional[Dict[str, Any]]): This parameter has a long type signature as well as a long description which makes it a good candidate for testing wrapping capabilities of the tool.

Returns:
    int: This is a return value description.
    tuple[int, str]: This is a return value with a very long description that needs to be wrapped because it exceeds the line length limit significantly and we want to ensure it looks good.

Raises:
    ValueError: This is a raises description.
    TypeError: This is a raises description with a very long text that needs to be wrapped because it exceeds the line length limit significantly and we want to ensure it looks good.
